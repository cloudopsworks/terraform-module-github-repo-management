  **Terraform GitHub Repository Management** is a Terraform module designed to help you automate and standardize the
  creation and ongoing management of GitHub repositories. It streamlines tasks like configuring repository settings, 
  managing access levels, and integrating with both GitHub-native and third-party servicesâ€”without the need to switch 
  between multiple interfaces.
